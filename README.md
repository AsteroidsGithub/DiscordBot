## Usage
**Note: Ruby is in active development and is not ready for public servers**.

We offer two ways to use Ruby in your server
1. Using the public bot
2. Hosting the bot yourself

although we recommend using the public version for better support, which hosting your own does **not** come with.
### Using the public version of Ruby

You will need knowlegde in Python to follow this and we provide no support for Users doing this
Make sure that Python 3 is installed on your computer
